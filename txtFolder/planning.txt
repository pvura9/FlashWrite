Project Overview: EEPROM-Backed Digital Diary

This will be a a serial terminal interface in which users can
- enter diary entries
- search entries by keyword
- retrieve entries by keyword
- secure entries with encryption

Components:
- Microcontroller
- Built-in or external EEPROM
- USB to Serial connection (for serial terminal interface)
- RTC module for timestamping

Tools:
- PlatformIO
- Serial Terminal (PuTTY)
- EEPROM system library
- Embedded C for firmware

Features:
1. Entry Writing Interface - prompt the user via serial to enter a diary entry and accept text up to a certain character limit

2. Entry Storage Logic - store entries as structs, entries are stored in eeprom sequentially, and maintain a simple index table at the start of eeprom with addresses of entries

3. Keyword-Based Search - read tags from index table and if keyword matches, print the corresponding entry by jumping to its eeprom addresses

4. Timestamping - use RTC to get the current date and store it alongside entries, and display the date when retrieving the entries

5. Encryption - use a basic encryption code to encrypt each character before storing and then decrypt it on retrieval
